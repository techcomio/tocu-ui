# Domain Driven Forms

The [tcomb library](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb) provides a concise but expressive way to define domain models in JavaScript.

The [tcomb-validation library](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-validation) builds on tcomb, providing validation functions for tcomb domain models.

This library builds on those two and **realizes an old dream of mine**.

# Benefits

With tcomb-form you simply call `<Form type={Model} />` to generate a form based on that domain model. What does this get you?

1. Write a lot less HTML
2. Usability and accessibility for free (automatic labels, inline validation, etc)
3. No need to update forms when domain model changes

# Flexibility

- tcomb-forms lets you override automatic features or add additional information to forms.
- You often don't want to use your domain model directly for a form. You can easily create a form specific model with tcomb that captures the details of a particular feature, and then define a function that uses that model to process the main domain model.

# Contributions

Thanks so much to [Chris Pearce](https://github.com/Chrisui) for pointing me in the right direction
and for supporting me in the v0.4 rewrite.

Special thanks to [William Lubelski](https://github.com/lubelski) ([@uiwill](https://twitter.com/uiwill)), without him this library would be less magic.

Thanks to [Esa-Matti Suuronen](https://github.com/epeli) for the excellent `humanize()` function.

Thanks to [Andrey Popp](https://github.com/andreypopp) for writing [react-forms](https://github.com/prometheusresearch/react-forms), great inspiration for list management.
